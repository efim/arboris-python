Requirements & Install
======================

Arboris-python requires `numpy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ to compute and
integrate the model during simulation.

The following modules are very useful, but are not mandatory:

*  `Vpython <http://www.vpython.org/>`_ to display and replay simulations,
*  `Matplotlib <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_ to plot some results,
   in the same manner as Matlab,
*  `h5py <http://alfven.org/wp/hdf5-for-python/>`_ to save simulation data in
   hdf5 files, in order to read results with other applications that python.
